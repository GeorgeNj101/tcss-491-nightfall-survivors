2D top-down wave-survival action game inspired by Vampire Survivors, where the player auto-attacks while dodging enemies, leveling up, and choosing upgrades. The MVP includes one hero, weapon, enemy, and a full wave-to-death loop; the final version expands with multiple weapons, enemies, upgrades, levels, and a polished experience.
